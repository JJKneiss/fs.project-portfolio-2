# Welcome to The Rogue's Gallery

## We're happy to have you roll with us!

### Rogue's Gallery, formerly D&Digital, is a C# console program designed to offer persistent D&D character creation and offer dice rolls. Converted to the JavaScript console, The Rogue's Gallery grew to include DOM elements as well. Still a work in progress, this program's scope will expand as features are added.
